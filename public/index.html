  <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
  <p>
    This service is <strong>NOT SECURE</strong>, in any sense of the word. It was
    lazily whipped together in an hour as a fun proof of concept.

    Both your secret message and the extraction password will be sent in
    cleartext to the server, and can be intercepted by any eavesdropper along
    the way. <strong>DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE FOR ANYTHING YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO
    HIDE OR PROTECT</strong>.
